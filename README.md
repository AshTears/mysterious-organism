# Mysterious Organism

This project is my solution to the challenge project, Mysterious Organism, on Codecademy in the Back-End Engineer path.

## Project Goals
Context: Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. 
Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at 
which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above 
sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of 
P. aequor for your research team to study.
